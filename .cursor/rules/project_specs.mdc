# Project Specs for LifeOS

## Overview

**LifeOS** is the foundational layer of a personal IRL system that continuously ingests, understands, and stores real-life context from video, audio, and interaction. The system enables memory recall, automation, and smart agents by embedding video summaries and activity metadata into a vector database for semantic retrieval and triggerable actions.

## TECH STACK

### Backend
- **FastAPI** – high-performance async API server
- **Asyncio** – non-blocking tasks for video/audio jobs
- **Redis + Redis Queue** – caching & job queuing for processing pipelines
- **S3** – long-term video and transcript storage
  - **Qdrant** – vector database for semantic search of videos
- **TwelveLabs** – video-to-text summarizer API
- **Open API** – understand automations (which tools to route to from clip summaries)
- **Supabase** – Auth and storing video data (to link to vector with same UUID)
CREATE TABLE video_data (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    s3_url TEXT,
    summary TEXT,
    task_id TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
- **Docker**

### Frontend
- **Next.js (React)**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Motion (previously Framer Motion)**
- **ShadCN**

## Key Features

### Context Capture & Search
- Continuous ingestion of real-life media (video/audio)
- Video summarization + embedding (via TwelveLabs)
- Embedding into Qdrant
- LLM-assisted querying of recent memory

### Agentic Automations
- LLMs trigger tool use based on embedded context
- Example: detect date mention → schedule event in Google Calendar
- Smart suggestions based on daily patterns

## UI DESIGN

### Layout
- **Tabs (bottom navigation):**
  - **Chatbot** – query life memory, trigger automations
  - **Recent Activity** – scrollable log of detected moments, labels, summaries
  - **Automations** – integrations (e.g., Google Calendar, Notion)

- **Top Section:**
  - Daily summary (auto-generated by LLM from past 24h activity)

- **Middle Section:**
  - **Search bar** – NLP queries over memory
  - **Rotating display** – widgets like time, weather, recent high-level activities
